* *minidemos* 
*minidemos* is a repository with minimal usages of features/libraries/languages for demonstration purposes.

** Contents
 - =alsa-audio= :: Playback of PCM thorugh Linux ALSA API interface

** Usage
Unless otherwise specified just build and run with ~make && ./main~
You could need to install specific dependencies. However I would try to mantain the code to the simplest possible form.
